# spacex_server

## Setup

1) Create a Firebase Project for your app and add the Firebase SDK to your server as described [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup).
2) Call main.py everytime you want to check for push notifications (e.g. every 10 minutes)

You can also use the Dockerfile to create a Docker container which calls the script.
